            <h2>Storyline</h2>
            <p>There is this dude called Zayd who's just chilling out all happy living his life probably enjoying some warm fresh donuts whilst playing Metroid Prime 3 Corruption with his warm Starbucks Latte on his Nintendo Wii, but then out of no where this pr!ck called Male_0X teleports him to this yard full of people running around screaming and all with this pretty girl that walks up to Zayd and asks him to hold her hand, so he does but then instantly gets teleported to this strange dimension..

I don't want to spoil to much, I want my game to have lots of complex lore to it, this is just the origin story and isn't mentioned at the beginning of the game it just skips to the part where you have been teleported, the rest of the story and why Male_0X is doing all this to him is revealed much later on in the game.

Sooooo if this game sounds fun and interesting to you, then I highly suggest you play it!</p>
